This repository holds the Matlab code I write to help me visulize concepts in Modern Physics (PHYS 285 at SFU).

## squareWell.m
The program plots the wavefunctions of the i-th and j-th state with time evolution. It also plots the superposition of the two wavefunctions with user defined properties. 

Syntax: a is the length of the well, and N = \[i,j] where i and j are quantum numbers.

sample1.pdf is generated using squareWell(1,\[2 3]). This plots the first and second excited states, meaning a = 2 and b = 3.
