# phys_proj
This repository holds the Matlab code I write to help me visulize concepts in Modern Physics (PHYS 285 at SFU).

# squareWell.m
Syntax: a is the length of the well, and N = [i,j] where i and j are quantum numbers.
The program plots the wavefunctions of the ith and jth excited state. It also plots the superposition of the two wavefunctions with user defined properties.
